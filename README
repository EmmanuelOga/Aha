Aha!
----

Henry S. Warren's 'Aha!' superoptimiser tool with a couple of mods make it more
appropriate for targeting ARM and Thumb code. e.g. It knows about the BIC and
RSB instructions.

Also various rejiggery of source the exact nature of which escapes me at the
moment.

Build a binary with:

    make EXAMPLE=<fragment>

Where <fragment> is one of the xxx.frag.c files in the source directory.

Then run the resultant 'aha' with the number of target instructions.

    ./aha 2

Enjoy.
